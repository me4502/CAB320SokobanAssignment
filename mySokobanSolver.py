def taboo_cells(warehouse):
    '''  
    Identify the taboo cells of a warehouse. A cell is called 'taboo' 
    if whenever a box get pushed on such a cell then the puzzle becomes unsolvable.  
    When determining the taboo cells, you must ignore all the existing boxes, 
    simply consider the walls and the target  cells.  
    Use only the following two rules to determine the taboo cells;
     Rule 1: if a cell is a corner and not a target, then it is a taboo cell.
     Rule 2: all the cells between two corners along a wall are taboo if none of 
             these cells is a target.

    @return
       A string representing the puzzle with only the wall cells marked with 
       an '#' and the taboo cells marked with an 'X'.  
       The returned string should NOT have marks for the worker, the targets,
       and the boxes.
